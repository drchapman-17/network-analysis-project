# Network Analysis Project (2022)


The aim of this project is to apply Network Analysis techniques to analyse Graphs extracted
from data concerning the European Economic Area (EEA) countries’ Public Debt evolution
over time.
We are also interested in analysing how these graphs’ topologies change over time, how corre-
lation impacts the network topology, and how they relate to another graph built from the EEA
countries borders, to understand in which context the generated network topology becomes
closer to it.

# Problem and Motivation 

This Project could make us able to better understand both:
- the dynamics of the evolution of public debt in a timespan which includes the beginning
of a global crisis (end of 2019/ beginning of 2020)
- how public debts relate to each other in an economic setting which is governed by the
same basic rules (free movement of persons, goods, services, and capital), like the EEA is.
